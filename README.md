Title: Code Quiz Challenge

Deployed Page Link: https://pburlew.github.io/Code-Quiz/

Technologies Used:
Javascript, HTML, DOM selectors, CSS

Summary: This is a Javascript-focused assignment. Using the provided basic HTML and CSS, I added Javascript to run a functioning coding quiz. The user is presented with a start screen explaining the instructions. When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the user begins to view multiple choice questions based on coding knowledge. When the correct answer is chosen, the user sees a CORRECT notification with sound effect and earns 10 points. Conversely, a wrong selection earns an INCORRECT notification, sound effect, as well as subtracting 10 points. If time runs out before an answer is selected, the user is penalized. 

After all questions are completed, the user enters their initials. Comparing their answer against local storage, the user can see how their score ranks against other quiz attempts.
